Description=This procedure estimates one or more conditional quantiles (0 <= q <= 1) for a linear model, using the rq function from the R quantreg package. In contrast, ordinary regression estimates the conditional mean. The procedure allows you to choose the estimation algorithm as well as the method for estimating the standard error. You can save both the residuals from the regression and the estimated coefficients.
Summary=Estimate one or more conditional quantiles for a linear model.
