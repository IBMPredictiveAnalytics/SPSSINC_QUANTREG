# SPSSINC QUANTREG
## Estimate one or more conditional quantiles for a linear model.
 This procedure estimates one or more conditional quantile  s (0 <= q <= 1) for a linear model. In contrast, ordinary regression estimates the conditional mean. The procedure allows you to choose the estimation algorithm as well as the method for estimating the standard error. You can save both the residuals from the regression and the estimated coefficients.
