# SPSSINC QUANTREG
## Estimate one or more conditional quantiles for a linear model.
 This procedure estimates one or more conditional quantile  s (0 <= q <= 1) for a linear model, using the rq function from the R   quantreg package. In contrast, ordinary regression estimates the cond  itional mean. The procedure allows you to choose the estimation algor  ithm as well as the method for estimating the standard error. You can   save both the residuals from the regression and the estimated coeffi  cients.
